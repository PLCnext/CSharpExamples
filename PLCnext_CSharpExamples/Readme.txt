This project creates an eCLR library DLL.

Adding a Function / Function Block
=======================================

1. Select the project in the solution explorer.
2. Open the item "Project" from the main menu or right-click the project.
3. Select the menu item "Add New Item ..."
4. Choose the category "Visual C# Project Items\eCLR"
5. Select one the following project items:

    "Function"
    "Function Block"
    "Function Container"
    
6. Enter the name of the function / function block.
7. Perform a click on the button "Add" to complete 
   this procedure. For functions a wizard appears
   to ask you for the return type of the function.

The following table shows how the IEC 61131-3 data types
are mapped to the .NET-Framework and to C#, respectively.
Variables of data types that are marked in the column "DataType Attribute" with
a '+' must have the optional attribute "DataType" for an unambiguous assignment.

Optional files for PLCnext Engineer Libraries
=============================================

Library Description
-------------------
The template contains the file "LibraryDescription.xml". 
This file contains additional description for the POUs and their formal
parameters which are shown as tool tips. 
It enables also the structuring of POUs into groups.
For the description of POUs use the elements "ProgramOrganizationUnit".
For structuring the element "ToolboxCategory" is used which must be referred in 
the "ProgramOrganizationUnit".

Localization
For supporting different languages the description file can be localized. For 
each language a separate file has to be created and added into the folder 
"ProjectItems". The file name must have the format 
LibraryDescription[.<culture>].xml where <culture> represents the culture, e.g. 
en, en-US, de, fr, zh-CN.
As default the 'neutral' file without the culture is used 
LibraryDescription.xml.

Help Files
----------
Libraries can include help files that contain a help page for each POU.
The format of the help file name is <library name>[_culture]_FBFun.chm
where <culture> represents the culture, e.g. en, en-US, de, fr, zh-CN.
The neutral help without the culture is used when no help file matches the 
current language of the engineering tool.
The engineering tool searches for the library function and function blocks 
through their names. If the help is generated with the "HTML Help Workshop" 
then these names must be defined as keys in the *.hhk file.
Insert help files into the project's folder "Help" and set the property 
"Build Action" to "Content".
Please note: The help file must be copied physically into the project's "Help" 
directory. Do not insert it as link.

Debugging the Library
=====================

For debugging an application on the device it is important that the actual C# 
code is executed on the PLC. Therefore first the C# project must be built and 
then the Engineering project containing the C# library. All must be downloaded
to the PLC.

Debugging an eCLR Device requires an unsecured TCP/IP connection. If the device
is secured then open a port for debugging. Refer the PLCnext community for more 
information: https://www.plcnext-community.net

1. In the Project Menu choose "Attach to Process...".
2. For transport choose "eCLR Device".
3. Click on "Browse" to choose the qualifier.
3a.) Enter the IP address of the device
3b.) Select the eCLR application image file that should be
     used for debugging.
4. Press "Attach" to start debugging the project on the eCLR
